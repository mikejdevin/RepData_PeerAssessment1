This is an R Markdown document.  It is for course 5 homework. First, read Le Data. 

```{r}
ledata <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```
A matrix makes everything better.

```{r}
library(reshape2)
betterdata <- acast(ledata, date ~ interval , value.var="steps")
```

Sum up steps per day, discarding NA values.

```{r}
daybyday <- rowSums(betterdata,na.rm = TRUE)
```

Now for Some kind of histogram.

```{r}
hist(daybyday)
```

Mean number of steps per day is
```{r}
mean(daybyday)
```
Median number of steps per day is
```{r}
median(daybyday)
```

Now we look at intervals across days, assuming NA values do not change the mean.

```{r}
timeaftertime <- colMeans(betterdata, na.rm = TRUE)
```

plot this

```{r}
plot(timeaftertime,type="l",ylab="avg. number of steps",xlab="5 minute interval over the day")
```

Total rows with NA in them is found.

```{r}
sum(is.na(rowSums(betterdata)))
```
Now to impute daily averages into the NA slots. First, find those days. Then completely NA days are set to 0. Otherwise, each NA is replaced by the daily mean.

```{r}
impooted <- betterdata
thosedays <- is.na(rowSums(betterdata)) 
demeans <- rowMeans(betterdata, na.rm = TRUE)
demeans[is.nan(demeans)] <- 0
for ( day in thosedays ) {
  thesetimes <- is.na(betterdata[day,])
  for ( everytime in thesetimes ) {
    impooted[day,everytime] <- demeans[day]
  }
}
```
New daily totals, mean and median found.
```{r}
newdaytotals <- rowSums(impooted)
mean(newdaytotals)
median(newdaytotals)
```
This looks the same, so we compare total steps in the two datasets
```{r}
sum(daybyday)
sum(newdaytotals)
hist(newdaytotals)
```
This indicates that the missing values are actually 8 missing days or data, so the daily average imputing changes nothing. 

To split the data into weekdays and weekends use isWeekday function form timedate library.
```{r}
library(timeDate)
thedroidswerelookingfor <- isWeekday(as.Date(rownames(betterdata)))
weekdata <- betterdata[thedroidswerelookingfor, ]
enddata <- betterdata[!thedroidswerelookingfor, ]
weekactivity <- colMeans(weekdata, na.rm = TRUE)
endactivity <- colMeans(enddata, na.rm = TRUE)
```
now plot these guys.
```{r}
plot(weekactivity,type="l",ylab = "avg. number of steps on weekdays",xlab="5 minute intervals over the day",main = "weekday")
plot(endactivity,type="l" ,ylab = "avg. number of steps on weekends",xlab ="5 minute intervals over the day",main = "weekend")
```


Now we conlclude people do different things on the weekend than the weekdays.
